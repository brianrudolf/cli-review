`cURL` - The ubiquitous tool used by people who don't even realize they are using it. In it's most essential form, `curl` can be used to implement the action of *get*ting data from a web server. Several permutations exist to use different protocols, utilize credentials for secure access, or to store the data in a file vs displaying the output in the terminal.

For REST(ful) users, HTTP PUT and POST methods are available.
