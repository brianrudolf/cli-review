# cli-review
A review of CLI tools that I use and aim to be able to use. This simple repository is intended to be a place for me to write down a description, some basic notes, and a few use cases for each tool. Practice makes perfect, code is best learned by use, so here we are.

Initial motivation: [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com/)
